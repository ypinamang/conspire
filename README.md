## Problem: 
AI assistants like ChatGPT and Google Gemini are becoming the ultimate source of advice for various problems. Hell, I found myself consulting ChatGPT to help me lay out a career path. Although AI chatbots provide helpful information, they are not human and therefore cannot understand real nuance in the real world as experienced by real people. Moreover, I think most of the information on LLMs is just regurgitated popular opinion on the internet.

## Solution: 
How about a platform where people can ask real professionals/consultants for advice. Link with someone who is already proficient at a skill you want to learn or connect with a beginner like yourself. Find someone who has already walked the path to the destination you want to reach. That's where conspire.com comes in.
